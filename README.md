**KnowTheBrand** is a MERN stack web app that allows users to look up info about the brands they purchase.

To try it out, download this repo and run `npm install` in the terminal before running `npm start`. You will also have to cd into the `server` folder in another terminal and follow the same steps there.

The data you receive from test queries will depend on what you make available in your local MongoDB; this feature is still a work in progress.

You will need to install the Rust/WebAssembly toolchain to try out the image upload/ML recognition feature. Detailed instructions here: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/quickstart.html

After you install all the tools, cd into `server/tensorflow` and run `wasm-pack build`. This should compile the necessary code imported into the Express server. This feature is only a demo version, although you can import/train your own Tensorflow models. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Yarn can be substituted for npm as the package manager if desired.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
